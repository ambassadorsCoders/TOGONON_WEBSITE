                <p> Bird cage blue and yellow by Yaelokre
                    The line "I can be different, I can't be puppetted" strikes me every time i hear it as someone
                     who's been controlled and silenced my entire life. It gives me hope that I'll unleash myself
                     from these strings and finally live my life free from the place that once held me down

                <p> Swerve City by deftones!! In the part 1:44 the combination of the electric guitar and the bass
                    is just wild, it Hits different especially when the lead joins in. THIS song is underrated!!

                <p> Duwag by Zild,
                    As someone that has a lot of regrets in my life, this songs just gets it idküòìüòì
                    it also helped me improve myself and avoid being in a situation where i say
                    "Ano kaya ang magaganap kung hindi ako nagpakaduwag?" again

                <p> Mostly , "past lives" by sapientdream . If one believes in the existence of a past life and specially feels connection
                     with their soulmate , it's really surreal. The beat specially as the song progresses it takes you back to the forgotten
                      past , unfolding the records of time . In a place which had been so familiar to you once yet now it gives a mixed feeling
                       between what's known and the unknown. Yet you'd feel much more at home there , than you do in this timeline.
                        And just appreciate the unchangeable and neverending affection you feel for your significant other once more.
                         As if you've fallen for them all over again, and will continue to do so, in each lifetime .
