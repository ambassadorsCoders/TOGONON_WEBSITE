            <p>One of my favorite songs, the beat, the vocals, even if the
                lyrics is inaudible it is still one of the best songs I've ever
                heard. I need more dreampop songs that are like this.

            <h1>Wicked - Korn ft. Chino Moreno</h1>

            </a>
            <p>I just love this song because Johnathan and Chino did a collab
                and I love these kinds of Nu Metal music, it's catchy
            </p>

            </a>
            <p>I really love the intro in this song, like I just love the 
                beat I can't really explain it it's just unique and underrated.

            <h1>Entombed - Deftones</h1>

            </a>
            <p>The intro, the guitar, drums, bass, EVERYTHING. I cannot express how good this song
                is but this song is really divine and ethereal. Artists should make more songs like this
            </p>

            <h1>Senkou - Kiryu</h1>

            </a>
            <p>I love the beat, the traditional instruments mixing with the new ones are something that I needed
                It made me start to like folk metal and the vocals are unique, I LOVE IT!!
